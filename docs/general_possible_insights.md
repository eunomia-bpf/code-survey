# Possible insight to help you look into the data

Let's provide some possible insights that can be derived from the data. These insights can help guide further analysis and exploration of the kernel codebase.

## Different Roles:

> If you can ask every kernel developer to do a completed survey/questionare about a commit/a mail, what kinds of people may be intereted in it?

Several groups may be interested in a comprehensive survey or questionnaire about kernel commits or mailing lists. These include:

1. **Kernel Maintainers**: They may use the survey to assess code quality, adherence to guidelines, and collaboration efficiency within their subsystem.
2. **Research Academics**: Researchers in software engineering, empirical studies, and open-source contributions could benefit from such data to analyze development practices, review processes, or trends in kernel development.
3. **eBPF and Kernel Developers**: Developers involved in specific areas (e.g., eBPF, network stack, or security) may want insights into peer reviews, integration patterns, or code changes for improving contributions.
4. **Linux Foundation/Community Leaders**: Organizations like the Linux Foundation may use this data to improve developer onboarding, contributor satisfaction, or the overall development ecosystem.
5. **DevOps and Tooling Developers**: Those building automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, or kernel tracing/profiling tools may use feedback to improve infrastructure around the kernel.
6. **Documentation and Training Teams**: People responsible for maintaining kernel documentation or training new developers could use insights from the survey to create better educational resources or workflows.
7. **Companies using Linux Kernel**: Companies that rely heavily on the Linux kernel may be interested in trends in development efficiency, stability, and collaboration, especially if it affects their specific use cases (e.g., cloud, embedded systems).

## What are 


## general software questions

Here are some **general software questions** that Code-survey can help answer, along with **eBPF-specific examples**:

### General Software Questions Code-survey Can Answer

1. **How do new feature introductions impact software stability and performance over time?**
   - *eBPF Example*: How has the introduction of `bpf_link` affected the stability and performance of the eBPF subsystem? Were there regressions or improvements after its implementation?

2. **What identifiable phases exist in a feature’s lifecycle? Is it new, mature, refactored, or deprecated?**
   - *eBPF Example*: What are the lifecycle phases of `bpf_link`, from initial development to stabilization and optimization? When and why might it enter a deprecation phase?

3. **How has one component interacted with other components over time?**
   - *eBPF Example*: How has `bpf_link` interacted with other kernel subsystems like networking or security? Have these interactions increased in complexity over time?

4. **What were the trade-offs considered in design decisions, and how do they manifest in the system's implementation?**
   - *eBPF Example*: What trade-offs were considered when introducing kfuncs in the eBPF subsystem versus using existing helper functions?

5. **What patterns can be observed in the frequency and type of commits related to a specific feature?**
   - *eBPF Example*: What trends can be seen in commits related to `bpf_link`? Were there bursts of activity during its development, followed by periods of stabilization?

6. **How do discussions in developer communications (e.g., mailing lists) influence design and implementation decisions?**
   - *eBPF Example*: How did developer discussions around `bpf_link` in the Linux kernel mailing list influence its final implementation? Were certain proposed features or ideas discarded?

7. **How does the collaboration between developers affect the consistency and coherence of feature development?**
   - *eBPF Example*: Did the collaboration between developers on the `bpf_link` feature lead to a consistent implementation, or were there conflicts that required refactoring or rollbacks?

8. **What dependencies have emerged between features, and how do they affect software evolution?**
   - *eBPF Example*: How does `bpf_link` depend on or affect other parts of the Linux kernel? Has it created any critical dependencies that influence the subsystem’s evolution?

9. **How does bug frequency correlate with feature complexity, and how are regressions managed?**
   - *eBPF Example*: Are more complex features in eBPF, such as `bpf_link`, associated with a higher frequency of bugs or regressions? How were these regressions addressed in follow-up commits?

10. **What lessons can be learned from the evolution of a subsystem that can be applied to other systems or features?**
    - *eBPF Example*: What insights from the development and refinement of `bpf_link` can be applied to improve other subsystems in the Linux kernel, such as the networking or filesystem layers?

---

These questions offer a **deep dive into software evolution**, providing insights into stability, collaboration, and design decisions. For each question, Code-survey can apply a structured analysis of unstructured data, such as commit messages, emails, and feature histories, to uncover patterns that would otherwise remain hidden.
