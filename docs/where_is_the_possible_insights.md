# Possible insight to help you look into the data

Let's provide some possible insights that can be derived from the data. These insights can help guide further analysis and exploration of the kernel codebase.

## Different Roles:

> If you can ask every kernel developer to do a completed survey/questionare about a commit/a mail, what kinds of people may be intereted in it?

Several groups may be interested in a comprehensive survey or questionnaire about kernel commits or mailing lists. These include:

1. **Kernel Maintainers**: They may use the survey to assess code quality, adherence to guidelines, and collaboration efficiency within their subsystem.
2. **Research Academics**: Researchers in software engineering, empirical studies, and open-source contributions could benefit from such data to analyze development practices, review processes, or trends in kernel development.
3. **eBPF and Kernel Developers**: Developers involved in specific areas (e.g., eBPF, network stack, or security) may want insights into peer reviews, integration patterns, or code changes for improving contributions.
4. **Linux Foundation/Community Leaders**: Organizations like the Linux Foundation may use this data to improve developer onboarding, contributor satisfaction, or the overall development ecosystem.
5. **DevOps and Tooling Developers**: Those building automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, or kernel tracing/profiling tools may use feedback to improve infrastructure around the kernel.
6. **Documentation and Training Teams**: People responsible for maintaining kernel documentation or training new developers could use insights from the survey to create better educational resources or workflows.
7. **Companies using Linux Kernel**: Companies that rely heavily on the Linux kernel may be interested in trends in development efficiency, stability, and collaboration, especially if it affects their specific use cases (e.g., cloud, embedded systems).
