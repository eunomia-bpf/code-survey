    perf lock contention: Fix spinlock and rwlock accounting

The spinlock and rwlock use a single-element per-cpu array to track
current locks due to performance reason.  But this means the key is
always available and it cannot simply account lock stats in the array
because some of them are invalid.

by setting the 'lock' value to 0 instead of deleting the entry for the

    bpf: Fix a crash when btf_parse_base() returns an error pointer

The pointer returned by btf_parse_base could be an error pointer.
IS_ERR() check is needed before calling btf_free(base_btf).
